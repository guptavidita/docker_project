 Bakery Foundation Example on Windows üçû
Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up and using Packer to create a machine image (AMI) on AWS. It covers installation, configuration, and deployment on Windows.

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

A Windows machine with administrator access.
An AWS account with IAM credentials.
Basic knowledge of AWS and PowerShell.
Step 1: Install Required Tools
1.1 Install Packer
Step 1: Download Packer
Open your browser and go to the Packer Download Page.
Download the latest Windows (64-bit) ZIP file.
Step 2: Extract Packer
Navigate to the downloaded ZIP file.
Right-click and select Extract All...
Move packer.exe to C:\packer (Create this folder if it doesn‚Äôt exist).
Step 3: Add Packer to System PATH
Open Environment Variables (Search for it in Windows).
Click Environment Variables ‚Üí Under System Variables, find Path ‚Üí Click Edit.
Click New, then add:
C:\packer
Click OK and close all windows.
Step 4: Verify Packer Installation
Open PowerShell and run:

packer --version
‚úÖ If successful, the Packer version will be displayed. Image

1.2 Install AWS CLI
Step 1: Download AWS CLI
Go to the AWS CLI Download Page.
Download and run the AWSCLI.msi installer.
Step 2: Install AWS CLI
Follow the on-screen steps: Next ‚Üí Next ‚Üí Finish.
Verify installation:
aws --version
‚úÖ If successful, it should display something like: aws-cli/2.x.x Windows/10 Image
1.3 Configure AWS CLI (5 minutes)
Run the following command in PowerShell:

aws configure
Enter the following when prompted:

AWS Access Key ID: <Your AWS Key>
AWS Secret Access Key: <Your AWS Secret>
Default region name: us-east-1 (or your preferred region)
Default output format: json (Press Enter) ‚úÖ AWS CLI is now configured. Image
Step 2: Create the Packer Template
2.1 Create the Packer HCL File
Open Notepad or VS Code.
Copy the following code into a new file:
packer {
  required_plugins {
    amazon = {
      source  = "github.com/hashicorp/amazon"
      version = ">= 1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

variable "aws_region" {
  default = "us-east-1"
}

source "amazon-ebs" "python39" {
  ami_name      = "bakery-foundation-python39-${formatdate("YYYYMMDD-HHmmss", timestamp())}"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  region        = var.aws_region
  source_ami    = "ami-0a25f237e97fa2b5e"
  ssh_username  = "ubuntu"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.amazon-ebs.python39"]

  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update",
      "sudo apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-venv python3.9-dev"
    ]
  }
}
Save the file as bakery.pkr.hcl in C:\packer.
2.2 Find a Valid Ubuntu AMI
Run the following AWS CLI command to get the latest Ubuntu AMI:

aws ec2 describe-images --owners 099720109477 --filters "Name=name,Values=ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*" --query "Images | sort_by(@, &CreationDate)[-1].ImageId" --output text
‚úÖ Update bakery.pkr.hcl by replacing the source_ami with the new AMI ID:

source "amazon-ebs" "python39" {
  source_ami = "ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Replace with actual AMI ID
}
Image

Step 3: Validate and Build the Image
3.1 Initialize and Validate Packer Template
Open PowerShell and navigate to C:\packer:

cd C:\packer
Initialize Packer:

packer init .
Validate the template:

packer validate bakery.pkr.hcl
‚úÖ Expected Output: The configuration is valid. Image

3.2 Build the Machine Image
Run the following command:

packer build bakery.pkr.hcl
Image

This will:

Create a temporary EC2 instance.
Install Python 3.9.
Convert it into an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
Delete the temporary instance.
Step 4: Deploy and Test the AMI
4.1 Find the AMI
Log in to AWS Console.
Navigate to EC2 ‚Üí AMIs (Set the region you used when creating the AMI).
Find the AMI named: bakery-foundation-python39-timestamp
Image
4.2 Launch an EC2 Instance with Your AMI
Go to AWS EC2 Console: AWS EC2 Dashboard.
Click Launch Instance ‚Üí My AMIs (Left Sidebar).
Search for your AMI and Select It.
Choose:
Instance Type: t2.micro (or higher, based on your needs).
Key Pair: Use an existing key or create a new one.
Security Group: Allow SSH (port 22) and other required ports.
Click Launch! üöÄ
Image
4.3 Connect to the Instance
Get the Public IP from the EC2 Console.

Open PowerShell and connect via SSH:

ssh -i "C:\path\to\your-key.pem" ubuntu@your-instance-ip
Image

Accept the SSH key fingerprint (First Time Only): Type yes and press Enter. ‚úÖ You are now logged into your EC2 instance! üéâ

4.4 Verify Python Installation
Once inside the instance, run:

python3.9 --version
‚úÖ Expected Output: Python 3.9.5 Image

Understanding Python Versions on Ubuntu
Default Python Version in Ubuntu
Ubuntu 20.04 comes pre-installed with Python 3.8.10. You can verify this by running:

python3 --version
Expected Output:

Python 3.8.10
Installing Python 3.9
Since Ubuntu manages multiple Python versions, you need to install Python 3.9 manually:

sudo apt-get install -y python3.9
Once installed, verify the installation:

python3.9 --version
Expected Output:

Python 3.9.5
Why python Command is Not Available by Default
By default, Ubuntu only includes python3, and not python. Running:

python --version
Results in:

Command 'python' not found
Why Ubuntu Uses python3 Instead of python
Legacy vs. Modern Versions:

Older Ubuntu versions had both Python 2 and Python 3.
python referred to Python 2, while python3 referred to Python 3.
Since Python 2 reached end-of-life (EOL) on January 1, 2020, Ubuntu 20.04 and later removed Python 2.
Ubuntu‚Äôs Design Choice:

If python was included by default, old scripts designed for Python 2 might break.
To enforce clarity, Ubuntu only includes python3.
Running python without installing it will always result in:

Command 'python' not found
üéâ Conclusion
You have successfully:
‚úÖ Set up Packer
‚úÖ Created an AWS AMI
‚úÖ Deployed an EC2 instance with Python 3.9

üöÄ Now you can use your instance for Python development on AWS!
You have successfully set up Packer, created an AWS AMI, and deployed an EC2 instance with Python 3.9! üöÄ
