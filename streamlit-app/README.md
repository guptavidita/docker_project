Evidently AI Streamlit App (Dockerized)
This project is a Streamlit application integrated with Evidently AI for monitoring and evaluating machine learning models. The entire app is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scaling.

ðŸ›  Features
Upload and manage datasets
Train machine learning models
Generate interactive evaluation reports using Evidently AI
Visualize model performance and data drift
Multipage Streamlit layout
Dockerized setup for smooth deployment
ðŸš€ Quick Start
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/ayushgabba/Docker_project.git
cd Docker_project/evidently-ai-streamlit
2. Build the Docker Image
docker build -t evidently-streamlit-app .
3. Run the Docker Container
docker run -p 8501:8501 evidently-streamlit-app
Then open your browser and go to:

ðŸ§ª Tech Stack
Streamlit â€” for the interactive web application
Evidently AI â€” for generating reports on model performance
Scikit-learn â€” for machine learning models
Docker â€” for containerization
Pandas, NumPy â€” for data manipulation
ðŸ“ˆ Example Use Cases
Monitor ML model data drift over time
Compare model performance across different datasets
Evaluate newly trained models before deployment
âš¡ Future Improvements
Integrate a database (like PostgreSQL or DynamoDB) to store uploaded datasets and models
Add user authentication and session management
Deploy to cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
